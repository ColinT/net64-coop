## Contributing Code

- Before submitting any code you should have a look at our [coding style](CODING_STYLE.md). Respecting these guidelines keeps the project organized and greatly accelerates the process of incorporating your changes into Net64.
- For small changes like correcting spelling / grammer mistakes or 1-line fixes it's usually enough to edit them in github directly.
- Before working on a big, new feature you should start a discussion on our issue tracker and let us know what you're planning to implement. That way we can give you direct feedback in advance so that you are not wasting your time working on something we might not want to implement.
- If you have questions about the code you can chat with fellow contributors in the #development channel of our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/GgGUKH8).
